# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Incident Response and Case Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive incident response and case management system with investigation tools, timeline reconstruction, collaboration features, and automated response actions.
# Details:
1. Create case management system with automated and manual case creation
2. Implement investigation tools for evidence collection and analysis
3. Develop timeline reconstruction for chronological event analysis
4. Create collaboration features for team communication and task assignment
5. Implement evidence preservation with forensic data collection
6. Develop playbook engine for configurable response actions
7. Create integration APIs for SOAR platform connectivity
8. Implement multi-channel notification system (email, SMS, Slack, Teams)
9. Develop escalation procedures based on severity and time
10. Create case reporting and documentation tools

Example incident response playbook:
```typescript
interface Playbook {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  triggerConditions: {
    alertType?: string;
    severity?: string[];
    tags?: string[];
    customCondition?: string;
  };
  steps: PlaybookStep[];
  approvalRequired: boolean;
  approvers?: string[];
  timeoutMinutes?: number;
  enabled: boolean;
}

interface PlaybookStep {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'manual' | 'automated';
  action: {
    type: string; // 'notification', 'api_call', 'enrichment', etc.
    config: Record<string, any>;
  };
  condition?: {
    field: string;
    operator: string;
    value: any;
  };
  onSuccess?: string; // ID of next step
  onFailure?: string; // ID of step to execute on failure
  timeout?: number; // in minutes
}

class PlaybookEngine {
  async executePlaybook(playbook: Playbook, alert: Alert, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<PlaybookResult> {
    logger.info(`Executing playbook ${playbook.id} for alert ${alert.id}`);  
    
    if (playbook.approvalRequired && !context.approved) {
      await this.requestApproval(playbook, alert, context);
      return { status: 'pending_approval' };
    }
    
    const result = await this.executeSteps(playbook.steps, alert, context);
    return result;
  }
  
  private async executeSteps(steps: PlaybookStep[], alert: Alert, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<PlaybookResult> {
    // Implementation of step execution logic
  }
  
  private async executeAction(action: PlaybookAction, alert: Alert, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<ActionResult> {
    // Implementation of action execution
  }
  
  private async requestApproval(playbook: Playbook, alert: Alert, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation of approval workflow
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Integration testing of case management workflow
2. Validation of timeline reconstruction accuracy
3. User acceptance testing for investigation tools
4. Performance testing of playbook execution
5. Testing of notification delivery and escalation
6. Validation of evidence preservation
7. Security testing of case data access controls
8. Test collaboration features with multiple users
