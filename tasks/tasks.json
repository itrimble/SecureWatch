      "details": "1. **Enhanced Schema System with Type Awareness**:\n   - Extend the existing KQL schema system to include field types (string, number, datetime, boolean, object)\n   - Add metadata support for field descriptions, examples, and validation rules\n   - Implement type-aware suggestions that filter completions based on context (e.g., only numeric fields for mathematical operations)\n   - Create schema versioning system to handle evolving data structures\n   - Add support for custom field annotations and tags for better categorization\n\n2. **Function Parameter Hints and Documentation**:\n   - Implement comprehensive parameter hints for all KQL aggregate functions (count, sum, avg, max, min, percentile, etc.)\n   - Add inline documentation with function descriptions, parameter types, and usage examples\n   - Create hover tooltips showing function signatures and return types\n   - Implement parameter validation with real-time error highlighting\n   - Add support for overloaded functions with multiple parameter signatures\n\n3. **Error Recovery and Graceful Fallback**:\n   - Implement robust error recovery parser that can handle malformed KQL queries\n   - Create fallback suggestion system that provides meaningful completions even with syntax errors\n   - Add partial query analysis to offer suggestions based on incomplete expressions\n   - Implement smart error correction suggestions (e.g., suggesting correct function names for typos)\n   - Create context-aware recovery that maintains IntelliSense functionality during typing\n\n4. **Table Join Suggestions**:\n   - Implement intelligent table join suggestions based on available relationships\n   - Add support for detecting common join patterns and suggesting appropriate join types\n   - Create foreign key relationship detection for automatic join field suggestions\n   - Implement join performance hints and optimization suggestions\n   - Add visual indicators for join compatibility and relationship strength\n\n5. **Nested Function Support**:\n   - Extend parser to handle complex nested function expressions\n   - Implement bracket matching and scope awareness for nested contexts\n   - Add intelligent parameter completion within nested function calls\n   - Create visual indicators for nesting levels and function boundaries\n   - Implement smart indentation and formatting for complex nested expressions\n\n6. **SecureWatch Integration**:\n   - Integrate enhanced IntelliSense into the main SecureWatch search interface\n   - Add keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys for common IntelliSense operations\n   - Implement search history integration with IntelliSense suggestions\n   - Create customizable IntelliSense preferences and settings\n   - Add performance optimizations for real-time suggestions in large datasets\n   - Implement caching strategies for schema and metadata to improve response times\n\n7. **Advanced Features**:\n   - Add support for custom function libraries and user-defined functions\n   - Implement query templates with parameter placeholders and IntelliSense integration\n   - Create snippet expansion system for common query patterns\n   - Add support for multi-line query formatting and smart indentation\n   - Implement collaborative features like shared snippets and query templates",
      "testStrategy": "1. **Unit Testing**:\n   - Test type-aware schema system with various field types and metadata configurations\n   - Verify function parameter hints accuracy for all supported KQL functions\n   - Test error recovery with intentionally malformed queries and edge cases\n   - Validate table join suggestions with complex multi-table scenarios\n   - Test nested function parsing with deeply nested expressions\n\n2. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Test IntelliSense integration within SecureWatch search interface\n   - Verify performance with large schema datasets (1000+ tables, 10000+ fields)\n   - Test real-time suggestion performance during active typing\n   - Validate caching mechanisms and schema update propagation\n   - Test keyboard shortcuts and user interaction flows\n\n3. **User Experience Testing**:\n   - Conduct usability testing with security analysts using complex KQL queries\n   - Measure suggestion accuracy and relevance in real-world scenarios\n   - Test error recovery effectiveness with common user mistakes\n   - Validate join suggestion quality with actual SecureWatch data relationships\n   - Assess learning curve reduction for new KQL users\n\n4. **Performance Testing**:\n   - Benchmark IntelliSense response times with large schemas (target <100ms)\n   - Test memory usage with extensive metadata and type information\n   - Validate suggestion filtering performance with large result sets\n   - Test concurrent user scenarios and resource utilization\n   - Measure impact on overall SecureWatch search interface performance\n\n5. **Compatibility Testing**:\n   - Test with various KQL query complexities and patterns\n   - Verify compatibility with existing SecureWatch query templates\n   - Test integration with saved searches and query history\n   - Validate cross-browser compatibility for web-based interface\n   - Test with different data source schemas and field naming conventions",
