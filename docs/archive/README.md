### Duplicate README Files

## Reason for Archival

These files were archived during the v2.1.0 documentation cleanup as they:
1. Reference the old 12+ service architecture (now consolidated to 8 services)
2. Document resolved issues and completed integrations
3. Contain duplicate content available in current documentation
4. No longer reflect the current system state after the major consolidation

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, refer to the main `/docs` directory which contains current guides reflecting the v2.1.0 consolidated architecture.
