# Component Import Resolution - June 3, 2025

## Overview
This document details the component import resolution completed on June 3, 2025, which fixed all missing component imports in the SecureWatch SIEM platform frontend.

## Problem Description
The frontend application had import statements referencing components that existed in the `src/components` directory but were being imported from `@/components`, which resolved to `frontend/components`. This caused build errors and 404 pages.

## Components Resolved

### 1. AlertsDisplay Component
- **Location**: `/frontend/components/dashboard/AlertsDisplay.tsx`
- **Referenced in**: `/frontend/app/alerts/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays real-time security alerts with filtering and status management
- **Features**:
  - Alert severity indicators (High/Medium/Low)
  - Status filtering (All/New/Acknowledged/Resolved)
  - Interactive actions (Acknowledge/Resolve)
  - Custom scrollbar styling

### 2. RuleEditor Component
- **Location**: `/frontend/components/rules/RuleEditor.tsx`
- **Referenced in**: `/frontend/app/alerts/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Interface for creating and editing detection rules
- **Features**:
  - Sigma-like syntax support
  - Rule metadata (name, description, severity)
  - Syntax highlighting placeholder
  - Save/Cancel actions

### 3. ReportGenerator Component
- **Location**: `/frontend/components/reporting/ReportGenerator.tsx`
- **Referenced in**: `/frontend/app/reporting/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive report configuration interface
- **Features**:
  - Time range selection with presets
  - Multi-source log filtering
  - Severity level filtering
  - Event ID specific filtering
  - Export format selection (PDF/CSV/JSON)

### 4. ScheduledReportsConfig Component
- **Location**: `/frontend/components/reporting/ScheduledReportsConfig.tsx`
- **Referenced in**: `/frontend/app/reporting/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Manage scheduled report configurations
- **Features**:
  - List of scheduled reports
  - Frequency and timing display
  - Recipient management
  - Edit/Delete actions
  - New report scheduling interface

## Solution Applied
All missing components were copied from their source location in `src/components` to the appropriate directories in `frontend/components`, maintaining the same directory structure:

```bash
src/components/dashboard/AlertsDisplay.tsx → frontend/components/dashboard/AlertsDisplay.tsx
src/components/rules/RuleEditor.tsx → frontend/components/rules/RuleEditor.tsx
src/components/reporting/ReportGenerator.tsx → frontend/components/reporting/ReportGenerator.tsx
src/components/reporting/ScheduledReportsConfig.tsx → frontend/components/reporting/ScheduledReportsConfig.tsx
```

## Build Verification
After copying the components:
- ✅ All imports resolved successfully
- ✅ Build completed with no errors
- ✅ All 15 pages generated successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider consolidating all components into a single location to avoid confusion
2. Update import aliases in `tsconfig.json` if maintaining separate component directories
3. Document the component architecture decision in the project documentation
4. Consider using a monorepo tool like Turborepo to better manage shared components

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Import Alias**: `@/` resolves to `frontend/` directory
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in bundler
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

This resolution ensures all frontend pages load correctly and the application functions as intended.
