## 🔄 Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Alerting (0-15 minutes)

#### Automated Detection Sources
- Security audit logs (`/tmp/security-audit.log`)
- Query complexity analyzer alerts
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Authentication failure patterns
- Cross-tenant access attempts
- Rate limiting violations

#### Manual Detection Sources
- Customer reports
- Security researcher notifications
- Third-party security alerts
- Monitoring dashboard anomalies

#### Initial Response Actions

```bash
# 1. Acknowledge the alert
curl -X POST http://localhost:4009/api/incident/acknowledge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"incidentId": "INC-2025-001", "acknowledgedBy": "analyst@company.com"}'

# 2. Gather initial context
tail -f /tmp/security-audit.log | grep -E "(CRITICAL|HIGH_RISK)"

# 3. Check system health
make monitor-startup
curl http://localhost:4004/search/circuit-breakers
```

### Phase 2: Initial Assessment (15-45 minutes)

#### Security Triage Checklist

- [ ] **Threat Validation**: Confirm if threat is genuine or false positive
- [ ] **Impact Assessment**: Determine affected systems, users, and data
- [ ] **Scope Analysis**: Identify if incident is isolated or part of larger campaign
- [ ] **Timeline Establishment**: Determine when incident started
- [ ] **Evidence Preservation**: Secure logs and forensic artifacts

#### Key Investigation Queries

```bash
# Check authentication events for specific user
grep "userId:USER_ID" /tmp/security-audit.log | grep -E "(LOGIN_FAILURE|PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION)"

# Analyze query patterns for anomalies
grep "COMPLEX_QUERY_EXECUTED\|QUERY_BLOCKED" /tmp/security-audit.log | tail -50

# Check cross-tenant access attempts
grep "CROSS_TENANT_ACCESS_ATTEMPT" /tmp/security-audit.log

# Review API key usage patterns
grep "API_KEY_INVALID\|API_KEY_EXPIRED" /tmp/security-audit.log
```

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level | Response |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| High | High | Critical | Immediate containment |
| High | Medium | High | Rapid response |
| Medium | High | High | Rapid response |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Standard response |
| Low | Any | Low | Monitor and document |

### Phase 3: Containment (45 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Immediate Containment Actions

**For Authentication Compromise:**
```bash
# Disable compromised user account
curl -X POST http://localhost:4006/api/users/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"userId": "COMPROMISED_USER_ID", "reason": "Security incident"}'

# Revoke all sessions for user
curl -X POST http://localhost:4006/api/sessions/revoke-all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"userId": "COMPROMISED_USER_ID"}'

# Blacklist suspicious IP addresses
curl -X POST http://localhost:4006/api/security/blacklist-ip \
  -d '{"ipAddress": "SUSPICIOUS_IP", "reason": "Security incident", "duration": "24h"}'
```

**For Query-Based Attacks:**
```bash
# Enable emergency query restrictions
curl -X POST http://localhost:4004/api/security/emergency-mode \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"enabled": true, "restrictions": {"maxComplexity": 25, "maxRows": 1000}}'

# Block specific organization if cross-tenant attack
curl -X POST http://localhost:4004/api/security/block-organization \
  -d '{"organizationId": "ORG_ID", "reason": "Security incident"}'
```

**For System Compromise:**
```bash
# Isolate affected services
docker-compose stop suspicious-service

# Enable enhanced monitoring
export SECURITY_ALERT_LEVEL=HIGH
make monitor-continuous
```

#### Short-term Containment
- Isolate affected systems
- Implement temporary access controls
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Disable compromised accounts
- Implement emergency security policies

#### Long-term Containment

   - What systems were compromised
   - What data was accessed or modified
   - What vulnerabilities were exploited

3. **Impact Analysis**

   - Systems affected
   - Business operations impacted
   - Regulatory implications

#### Eradication Actions

```bash
# 1. Apply security patches
pnpm audit fix
docker pull latest-security-images

# 2. Reset compromised credentials
./scripts/reset-security-credentials.sh

# 3. Update security configurations
./scripts/apply-security-hardening.sh

# 4. Regenerate API keys and certificates
./scripts/rotate-secrets.sh
```

### Phase 5: Recovery (8-24 hours)

#### Recovery Checklist
