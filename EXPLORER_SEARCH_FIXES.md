# Explorer Page Search Bar and Calendar Z-Index Fixes

## Summary

Fixed redundant search elements and calendar z-index issues in the SecureWatch SIEM Explorer page.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Redundant Search Elements

**Problem**: Two search bars were present on the Explorer page:

- Top-level search bar in SplunkHeader component
- Main search bar in Explorer page component

**Solution**: Removed the redundant top-level search bar by disabling it in SplunkHeader.

**Files Modified**:

- `/Users/ian/Scripts/SecureWatch/frontend/components/splunk-header.tsx`
  - Changed `showSearchBar` logic from `pathname === '/explorer' || pathname === '/'` to `false`
  - This removes the simplified search bar from the header area

### 2. Calendar Z-Index Issues

**Problem**: Calendar components in time picker popovers appeared behind other UI elements due to insufficient z-index values.

**Solution**: Added explicit z-index styling to ensure proper layering.

**Files Modified**:

- `/Users/ian/Scripts/SecureWatch/frontend/components/splunk-header.tsx`
  - Added `z-50` class to PopoverContent (line 259)
- `/Users/ian/Scripts/SecureWatch/frontend/app/explorer/page.tsx`
  - Added `z-50` class to PopoverContent for time range picker (line 667)
  - Added `z-50` class to PopoverContent for query history (line 635)
  - Added `z-50` class to Calendar component (line 714)

## Technical Details

### Search Bar Architecture

The Explorer page now uses a single, comprehensive search interface with:

- Multi-line KQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Query history functionality
- Advanced time range picker with presets and custom ranges
- Search status indicators and progress tracking
- Integrated field filtering and statistics

### Z-Index Strategy

Applied consistent z-index values:

- `z-50` for all popover content and calendar components
- Ensures proper layering above other UI elements
- Maintains accessibility and usability

## Testing

- Build compilation successful
- No TypeScript errors
- UI components properly layered
- Single search interface active on Explorer page

## Impact

- Improved user experience with single, focused search interface
- Eliminated confusion from duplicate search controls
- Fixed visual layering issues with calendar components
- Maintained all existing functionality

## Files Changed

1. `/Users/ian/Scripts/SecureWatch/frontend/components/splunk-header.tsx`
2. `/Users/ian/Scripts/SecureWatch/frontend/app/explorer/page.tsx`

## Follow-up Recommendations

- Consider implementing consistent z-index strategy across all components
- Evaluate other pages for similar redundant UI elements
- Test calendar functionality across different screen sizes and browsers
